## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r libraries, message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
```

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

#### Including Plots

---  <!-- THIS COLORED PART IS COMMENTED OUT, but the three dashes in front of the comment make a little dividing line in you knited document -->

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, message=F, warning=F}
# Now when you want to make a inside of and R chunk you would need to put the # sign in front so it's a little different depending on if you are inside or outside of an R chunk.
pressure %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = temperature, y = pressure)) +
  geom_point()

```

Note that the `message=F, warning=F` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of warnings that or other messages that might be tied to the graph. Sometimes R removes variables like NA's automatically and it would warn you when it does adding `message=F, warning=F` would remove that warning. 

Also if you noticed above there are 4 **#** in front of Including Plots which makes the Section header smaller then the one above it. The more **#** you put in front the smaller the section header gets.


## Scripts 

Scripts are another type of document that you can use in Rstudio, it's basically a text file where you can write commands that you would write either in an R chuck as shown above or in the console. I like to think of as scratch paper for my coding. 

Scripts do not knit into documents like RMD's but they can be very helpful to source or to create you visuals or do your wrangling before you put your information into an RMD. We will work with both but ultimately its up to personal preference. 

## Console 

The console is a place where temporary code is used, this is a good place for diagnostics. It's good place to run the `?` function, for example try `?tidyverse` in the console, the help file for `tidyverse` should have popped up in the bottom right panel of Rstudio. There good things do in the console are `View(KidsFeet)` for viewing data sets or `head(KidsFeet)` or `table(KidsFeet$sex)`.

I don't suggest editing data sets or graphing in the console.

## Working Directory, Paths, and Reading in Data

In the console type `getwd()` and hit enter. The result should be you current working directory in essence this is where your computer is working. This is very important to know if you are trying to bring in your own data. To read in data you need to have the correct file path, basically you need to give you computer directions.  

Let's try!

```{r}

```
